Databases
=========
We may be able to get more specific eventually but for now I'll just lump everything together here.
### SQL
- [Learn SQL the Hard Way](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/)  
Written by Zed Shaw (who has also written Learn \<thing\> the Hard Way for python, ruby, the command line, and others)  It's a series of relatively short chapters but there is a big emphasis on exercises.
- [Schemaverse](https://schemaverse.com/)  
This I haven't tried but it looks awesome
- [SQLZOO](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_basics)  
More interactive things to work through
